In this circle of hell we find an icy lake with 4 different
levels depending on the severity of the soul's judgement.

I guess since we just committed fraud in the last circle
of hell we've abandoned our morals....

Let's continue the sin streak in this last treacherous circle.
Maybe since we're committing treachery in the deepest circle
of hell it's like a double negative type thing...?

Anywho... to finish up.  Delete all contents of the `icy-lake`
and the `icy-lake` itself.  Of course, feel free to explore 
before committing this treachery.

Great work! Hopefully you'll remember some bash commands
and our friendship after this journey.

Your pal,
Virgil
