Here we're supposed to see two groups of people jousting... 
but I don't see anyone even looking for hidden people...

Use commandas to create two blank files, one named `hoarders` 
and one named `spenders`. Make sure you've named them *exactly*
like this. 

Once you've created them run the program `joust` by typing `./joust`.  
The program will either depict the jousting scene (v gruesome) or 
let you know that you didn't create the needed files.

If you get an error saying `permission denied: ./joust` run the 
command `chmod +x joust`; this gives the `joust` program permission 
to be executed (aka ran). Look more into the `chmod` command and what 
all it can do.

For extra exposure to what bash can do you can look into the contents 
of the `joust` file.

After viewing the joust navigate the fifth circle of hell: `anger` >:(
