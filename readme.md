*Hopefully obvious disclaimer: this doesn't reflect/impose religious beliefs but is just an exploration of an incredibly famous work of literature as a way to motivate the somewhat boring learning of commands*

Let's learn about Dante Alighieri's *Divine Comedy* at the same time we learn about bash! (idk man I went to a liberal arts college...). This epic poem has the famous *Inferno* where we're toured by Virgil through the 9 circles of hell.



To really practice, use ***<u>only</u>*** your bash command line to navigate the file structure that represents the circles of hell.

## How to

1. Get these files on your computer ([download](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/dantes-inferno/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip OR [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo)
2. Open up a bash window in the root directory of this project
  * Terminal app on Mac
  * Gitbash on Windows
3. Type `cat virgil` to get started
4. `virgil` will be available in each level of hell; use `cat` to get instructions on what to do before moving deeper into bash hell
5. Use google/chatgpt/etc to help discover what commands to run.  This activity doesn't tell you how to do all the things; it just brings up common tasks to know how to do and is an environment to practice.
